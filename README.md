# blind-mac-tutorial

A tutorial of how to make iOS apps on Mac as a blind person.

# Installing what you need.

## swift / Objective-C

### Xcode.

Go to the Mac App Store, find the search field, and type in "Xcode" without the quotes. The first result should be Xcode, developer tools, by Apple. It's a Mac app, so if you have an M1 Mac and are not seeing it, make sure Mac apps is selected. Once you find it, press download, and let it download. It's a fairly large download, but it gives you quite a lot of tools.

Note: you can just get the Xcode developer tools on their own, meaning a much smaller download, but that's for other languages. It will come later in the article.

# Xcode.

## The start screen.

This screen is optional, but is turned on by default. You have some text, and a few buttons. You can clone, create projects, etc., as well as turn off the screen, and create new projects through the menu bar.

##project creation.

This set of screens is pretty self-explanatory, and not that hard to understand. If people wish though, I'll update this with more information.

The main thing of notice here is the bundle identifier. This is your domain name reversed, with the app name at the end. For example, apple's keynote bundle ID would be com.apple.keynote. If you don't have a domain, me.yourLastName.yourFirstName will be fine. If you don't have a domain though, you should get one, even if it's just a simple Wordpress sight, as you need to host a privacy polocy when publishing.
