A tutorial of how to make iOS apps on Mac as a blind person.

# Installing what you need.

## swift / Objective-C

### Xcode.

Go to the Mac App Store, find the search field, and type in "Xcode" without the quotes. The first result should be Xcode, developer tools, by Apple. It's a Mac app, so if you have an M1 Mac and are not seeing it, make sure Mac apps is selected. Once you find it, press download, and let it download. It's a fairly large download, but it gives you quite a lot of tools.

Note: you can just get the Xcode developer tools on their own, meaning a much smaller download, but that's for other languages. It will come later in the article.
